## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

- Dealing with Parse for the first time presented a new learning curve.
- Manipulating images to rotate/resize or write/read from directory was tricky.
- Had trouble logging in through the emulator (works perfectly on physical devices though) and therefore spent quite some time recording a GIF.
